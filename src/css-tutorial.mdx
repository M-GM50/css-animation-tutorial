## Introduction to CSS animations:

The cool thing about computers is that they can do things instantaneously. You click on a link, it takes you immediately to a webpage. Simple and efficient, but unpleasant for our eyes; it’s like when you open a window in a dark room. You need light to see, but don’t want all of it at once, you want a smooth transition from dark to light.

It’s the same for websites; you want things to go smoothly. CSS animations help you achieve that goal by changing the style of an element over time.

## Setting up the HTML:

Create an HTML file with an empty div.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Sunrise to Sunset</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="sun_moon"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Defining the CSS styles:

Create a CSS file and add the basic styles to create a full moon in a night sky.

```css
body {
  background-color: darkblue;
}

.sun_moon {
  height: 80px;
  width: 80px;
  top: 30px;
  left: 30px;
  border-radius: 40px;
  color: white;
}
```

## What are keyframes?

Keyframes are like variables in which you specify your styles at various points during an animation. We’ll get to that in a second, let’s see how the syntax works for now.

If you take a second look at the animation, you’ll notice that two elements are transitioning: the moon becomes the sun, and the sky turns from dark to light blue.

<Slider />

You guessed correctly, you need two keyframes, one for each element. Let’s start with one. And like all variables, they need a name. Let’s call our keyframe for the sky, `skyChange`.

## Syntax!

There are a few syntax specifications you’ll need to remember. (CSS just doesn’t like it when things are too simple!). You need to remember the `@` (if you are familiar with media queries, this should ring a bell).

The `@` is immediately followed by the keyword `keyframes`. (Don’t ask me why it takes an `s`, your guess is as good as mine).

And now we have an empty keyframe where we can define our animation.

```css
@keyframes skyChange {
}
```

## How to define our keyframes?

Keyframes let us define what we want to change, at what point in time, and how they change. In this instance, we need our background to change gradually.

- At 0% (the beginning of the animation) start with dark blue, our original color.
- At 50% (halfway through the animation) transition from dark blue to light blue.
- 100% (the end of the animation) end with light cyan.

Looks straightforward enough. But once again, you need to pay attention to the syntax.

The time sequence is measured in percentages (%), this is what you use to tell CSS from which point to which point it needs to do a transition. This can be any value between 0 and 100.

Secondly, between curly brackets `{}`, define which property needs to be changed, set the new value. In our case, we want the background-color to change.

And there you have it, you’ve created your first keyframe.

```css
@keyframes skyChange {
  0% {
    background-color: darkblue;
  }
  50% {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: lightcyan;
  }
}
```

## Making things move:

Yes, I know, you want to see something move. Your wish is about to come true.

Like I said before, a keyframe is like a variable, so it needs to be assigned to something.

We can apply them to a specific selector using the `animation` property. Here we assign it to the body.

```css
body {
  background-color: darkblue;
  animation: skyChange;
}
```

Great! Now the program knows what it needs to change. It knows that the background needs to be changed at 50% and 100% of the animation sequence. But how long is the animation sequence? We need to specify a duration.

Let’s set it to five seconds.

```css
body {
  background-color: darkblue;
  animation: skyChange 5s;
}
```

Let's see what it does:

<Video src="/noloop.mp4" />

Excellent! Our night became day. But wouldn’t it be cooler if our animation was on a loop? We can do that by adding a new value: `infinite`.

```css
body {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: darkblue;
  animation: skyChange 5s infinite alternate;
}
```

The result is this:

<Video src="/infinite.mp4" />

Still looks weird, huh? Don’t worry, we’ll fix it! There’s a magic word that can control the animation direction, `alternate`.

Once a sequence is over, this will play the animation backwards, from 100% to 0% and then forward again.

<Video src="/alternate.mp4" />

That’s more like it!

## The `animation` property:

Here we used the `animation` property, which is a shorthand. Here are all the detailed values that are equivalent.

```css
body {
  animation-name: skyChange;
  animation-duration: 5s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-direction: alternate;
}
```

Now we can animate our moon/sun.

## Animating our sun and moon:

This tutorial is almost over. Remember our `sun_moon` div? That’s what we’re going to target next.

![sun_moon](/code-side.png)

Just as we did with `skyChange`, we need to create a new keyframe. Let’s call it `moonToSun`.

```css
@keyframes moonToSun {
}
```

Remember the `@` and the `s` at the end of `keyframes`.

Now, what we want is the background of our `sun_moon` to turn from white to yellow. Let’s write that down and see what happens.

```css
@keyframes moonToSun {
  from {
    background-color: white;
  }
  to {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
}
```

We use the `from` and `to` keywords, which are the same as saying `0%` and `100%`, they're just a bit more intuitive.

Let’s apply our keyframe to our `sun_moon` class.

```css
.sun_moon {
  height: 80px;
  width: 80px;
  top: 30px;
  left: 30px;
  border-radius: 40px;
  color: white;
  animation: moonToSun 5s infinite alternate;
}
```

And it works! CSS is easy sometimes!

## Conclusion:

And we’re done! We learned two ways of doing CSS animations. It’s pretty straightforward. CSS does the hard work for you.

You can use either syntaxes. The one with the percentages is used when we need to get through different steps. For example, you can try to add a twilight sequence with an orange-ish background and a red sun.
